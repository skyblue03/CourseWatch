# Ethical use / scraping notes

CourseWatch is designed to monitor **publicly accessible pages only**.

- No logins, no session scraping, no student system access.
- Polling interval is intentionally moderate (default 15 minutes).
- Adds delays between requests.
- If the site blocks requests or errors frequently, reduce frequency or stop using the tool.

This tool is not affiliated with any university.
